apitest.html

This is a javascript tester of RESTful APIs. It will programatically and repetitively 
call an API producing a log of the response time. It can be run over an entire 
day or for just a few minutes.

This test shows the availability and reliability of an API over a period of time. 
This is not meant to be a stress test. Nor is it meant to abuse any API. So use 
cautiously and wisely.

A log is created on the HTML page in a comma delimited format that may be imported 
into any charting program.
